## ⚙️ How It Works

1. User fills out a health form with medical info like:
   - Age
   - Resting Blood Pressure
   - Cholesterol Level
   - Maximum Heart Rate
   - Fasting Blood Sugar
   - Chest Pain Type
   - And other related features

2. The data is passed to a trained ML model which predicts:
   - **0**: No risk of cardiovascular disease  
   - **1**: At risk of cardiovascular disease

3. Result is displayed instantly on the screen.
